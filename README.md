# Design and Application of a Machine Learning System for a Practical Problem
The objective of this investigation is to assess the effectiveness of various machine learning 
techniques in forecasting customer behaviour in response to increasing energy costs. The 
study was conducted utilizing two datasets provided by AENERGY. The first dataset 
comprises historical customer information and a label indicating whether the customer 
experienced difficulties in paying their energy bills in recent months. The second dataset 
comprises historical customer information and a numerical value representing the annual 
expenditure variation for each customer as a result of increased energy costs.
The aim of the investigation is to use these datasets to train and evaluate machine learning 
models for the prediction of customer behaviour. The models considered in this study include 
decision trees, k-nearest neighbor and XGBoost for the first dataset as it is a classification 
problem. For the second dataset, linear regression, ridge, decision tree, random forest, and 
XGBoost were tested. The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as 
accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and Rsquared. The results of this investigation have provided valuable insight into the capability of 
machine learning models to predict customer behaviour in response to increasing energy 
costs
